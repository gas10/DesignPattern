### OO Basics
Abstraction
Encapsulation
Polymorphism
Inheritance

### OO Principles
Encapsulate what varies.
Favor composition over inheritence.
Program to interfaces, not implementations.

### OO Pattern
Strategy - defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable. Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it
